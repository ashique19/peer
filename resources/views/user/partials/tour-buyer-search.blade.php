    <h3>Search bar</h3>
    <p>
        The buyer search page is a list of the products buyers are looking for. Find requests from people who want products to where you are headed. Send them an offer with your preferred carrying fee. Use the search bar to narrow your results and view requests from your destination country.

    <h3>Send request</h3>
    <p>
        When you find an item you’re willing to carry and deliver, send a request to the buyer. This means you get to tell the buyer how much you are asking for to deliver the product to them. (Please include all taxes and custom fee(s) here if applicable).

    <h3>Message</h3>
    <p>
        We love having an open platform that let’s you get social with the people you’re dealing with. Send a buyer a message to better communicate with them about their product request.
